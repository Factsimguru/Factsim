# Beware:

-   it is not well documented
-   Some complex circuits with a lot of loopbacks are behaving strangely at the moment.

# Future:

-   I'll try to add some documentation, but if you have dobts please ask, I'm very new to programming so I'm grateful for feedback.
-   I think tkinter is a bit limited as a GUI framework, ill try to get the best out of it and maybe in the future overhaul it with a different framework.
