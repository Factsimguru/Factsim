# Factsim

a simulator for Factorio circuit network entities


<a id="org0ff0f2c"></a>

# Current features:

-simulates the output of different componets
-has a factsim class that can make the components interact


<a id="org5f20b3e"></a>

# Beware:

-it is not well documented
-it fails in complex circuits


<a id="orgd374f10"></a>

# Future:

+I'll try to add some documentation, but if you have dobts please ask, I'm very new to programming so I'm grateful for feedback.
  +I dont know if sequential programming is giving problems in the simulation so I may try the asyncio since I also want to get familiar with it for other projects just as an excersise
  +If people get interested then proper tests and debugging must be done to find out why in my complex train system it fails. The circuit is very complex with many combinators looped, bridged and all kind of undecorous things going on so it'll be tough.
